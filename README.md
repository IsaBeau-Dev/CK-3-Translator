# CK 3 Translator
To use you need to do
1. Install python and pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
2. Execute the installer.exe (this installs everything needed from https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate and other needed imports) !!This may take some time !!!
3. Execute main.exe


 
Uses: https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate to translate

Backend is based on a edited version of: https://github.com/CyberNord/CK3_LocalizationChanger
The new part is the User Interface aka that you can use it graphically and also the implementation of https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate, so it is working offline and doesn`t have a cooldown cardcoded to translate a new line
