The box to put text in at the top is the path to your localization folder for example:`C:\Users\isabeau\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod\test\localization\english` The first selecting is the language you want to translate from and the second one is the target.
You can also switch between light and dark mode

Uses: https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate to translate

Backend is based on a edited version of: https://github.com/CyberNord/CK3_LocalizationChanger
The new part is the User Interface aka that you can use it graphically and also the implementation of https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate, so it is working offline and doesn`t have a cooldown cardcoded to translate a new line
